ScenarioYou   are the   principal   of a   financial   planning   firm   (you hold   an AFSL),   recently   engaged by   a   married   couple   to   provide   retirement   planning   advice.   They   have   provided   the   following   information in relation to their personal and   financial   circumstances.The   husband   and   wife   are   both   aged    65   and   are    (the    only)    members    of   a    Self-Managed   Superannuation   Fund   (SMSF).   They   advise   that   there   is   a   total   value   of just   over   $700,000   accumulated   in   the   fund,   comprising   investment   in   Australian   equities   and   cash.   For   many   years,   they   have   aimed   to   maintain   an   approximately   50-50   split   between   these   two   asset   classes   (they   didn’t   explain   why).   The   current   asset   holdings,   with   prices   stated   at   market   value on the date   of   the   meeting,   are below:
•          2,000   NAB fully paid   ordinary shares   @   $36.55
•          3,500   BHP fully paid   ordinary shares   @   $41.95
•         400   CSL fully paid   ordinary shares   @   $305.20
•          1,350   GMG fully paid   ordinary shares   @   $34.98

•         the   cash investment is a   deposit in   the   amount   of $300,000   with   NAB   (paying   4.75%   p.a. and maturing   in   6   months).
Assume that each of   the shares pays   fully   franked   dividends.
They   also   advised   that   they   own   their   home,   have   around   $110,000   in   lifestyle   assets,   and   have two married adult children   and   three   grandchildren.
Assignment 1  [5 + 5 + 5 = 15 marks] 
Answer the following:
1.       Clearly explain your obligations as a financial planner that would apply if   the clients were   to   engage   you   to   prepare   a   Statement   of Advice   (note:   you   are not required   to   prepare   such   statement   in   these   assignments).
2.       You have   determined that the   clients   have   not   provided   sufficient   information   to   enable   you to provide financial   advice that meets   regulatory   requirements.   Identify   and   explain   what   further   information you would   seek   from   them   to   enable you   to   prepare   a   SoA.   In   your explanation, address how you perceive the clients’ degree of   risk aversion,   and   how   you would seek to assess this   more   formally.
3.       Based on   the client’s    degree   of   risk   aversion   that   you   identified   in   part   (2),   give   your   opinion   as   to   whether   the   current   asset   allocation   is   optimal   for   them   (be   aware   of the   possibility that the portfolio might be   difficult to   improve   upon).   Explain   the   reasons   for   your opinion.
Assignment 2  [3 + 6 + 6 = 15 marks] 
The   clients   emphasise   that   they   are   ready   to   retire   and   seek   your   advice   in   determining   a   suitable financial plan that focuses on their   retirement   income   stream   (RIS)   needs.
Answer the following:1.       If you were   to   prepare   a   SoA,   the   main   focus   would   be   on   ensuring   an   adequate   RIS   for   your clients. One alternative that you would need to consider is the implementation of   an   annuity strategy, e.g. cashing in all   or   part   of   the   lump   sum   accumulation   and   purchasing   a term or lifetime annuity.   Explain the advantages   and   disadvantages   of   this   alternative.
2.       Assuming   you choose to recommend the ‘purchase annuity’ strategy, provide details such   as annuity cost, indexation rate if   applicable, and   amount   of starting annual   annuity   (you   can find current yields on annuity purchase prices by consulting the web site of a   provider such as Challenger. If   the proposed annuity term does   not lineup with available   information, just make an   educated   estimate   of   the yield,   e.g. by interpolation).
3. What is your main advice   for   the   clients   in   relation   to   the   lump   sum   accumulation?   That   is, do you recommend maintaining the current portfolio, or the ‘purchase      annuity’   strategy,   or   something   else?   Explain your   advice   by   demonstrating that   it   is the   optimal   use of   the lump sum accumulation   for your   clients’   needs.
